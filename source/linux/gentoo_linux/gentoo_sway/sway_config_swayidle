### Idle configuration
#
# Example configuration:
#
exec swayidle -w \
         timeout 300 'swaylock -f -c 000000' \
         timeout 600 'swaymsg "output * power off"' resume 'swaymsg "output * power on"' \
         before-sleep 'swaylock -f -c 000000'
#
# This will lock your screen after 300 seconds of inactivity, then turn off
# your displays after another 300 seconds, and turn your screens back on when
# resumed. It will also lock your screen before your computer goes to sleep.
