--
Wayland requires XDG_RUNTIME_DIR to be defined to a path that will
contain "wayland-%d" unix(4) sockets. This is usually handled by
consolekit2 (via ck-launch-session) or pam_xdg (via login).

Message from seatd-0.8.0_1:

libseat is used to get DRM master and input devices for non-root users.
On Wayland this is only necessary when starting a compositor under KMS
console (e.g., /dev/ttyv0 backed by /dev/dri/card0). Nested sessions like
"Wayland on X11" or "Wayland on Wayland" don't need extra configuration.

By default libseat tries to find the first working backend. To override
set LIBSEAT_BACKEND via environ(7). Available backends and try order:

* "seatd" - seatd-launch(1) or seatd rc.d(8) service
* "consolekit2" - ck-launch-session(1) or pam_ck_connector(8)

"seatd" backend requires membership in "video" group to be allowed to
use setuid bit in seatd-launch(1) or connect to seatd(1) socket.

  # pw groupmod video -m <user>
  $ exit # log out to refresh group permissions

For example, to start a wlroots-based compositor replace "sway" with
your compositor (e.g., "hikari", "wayfire", "labwc", "river") then run

  $ seatd-launch sway

Alternatively, configure and run seatd(1) as system service

  # sysrc seatd_enable=YES
  # service seatd start
  $ sway

To use ConsoleKit2 run

  # pkg install consolekit2 basu
  # sysrc -x seatd_enable
  # service seatd stop
  # sysrc dbus_enable=YES
  # service dbus start
  $ ck-launch-session sway

where "ck-launch-session" can be dropped after

  # echo "session optional pam_ck_connector.so" >>/etc/pam.d/system
  $ exit # log out to re-trigger PAM
