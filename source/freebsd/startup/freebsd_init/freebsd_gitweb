If you installed the GITWEB option please follow these instructions:

In the directory /usr/local/share/examples/git/gitweb you can find all files to
make gitweb work as a public repository on the web.

All you have to do to make gitweb work is:
1) Please be sure you're able to execute CGI scripts in
   /usr/local/share/examples/git/gitweb.
2) Set the GITWEB_CONFIG variable in your webserver's config to
   /usr/local/etc/git/gitweb.conf. This variable is passed to gitweb.cgi.
3) Restart server.


If you installed the CONTRIB option please note that the scripts are
installed in /usr/local/share/git-core/contrib. Some of them require
other ports to be installed (perl, python, etc), which you may need to
install manually.
