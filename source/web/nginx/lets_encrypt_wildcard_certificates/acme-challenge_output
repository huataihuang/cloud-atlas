Please deploy a DNS TXT record under the name:

_acme-challenge.cloud-atlas.dev.

with the following value:

QE7TvP8sgOgfOzHYcTeePwf5IrobSO04Lb22rHh_cmU

Before continuing, verify the TXT record has been deployed. Depending on the DNS
provider, this may take some time, from a few seconds to multiple minutes. You can
check if it has finished deploying with aid of online tools, such as the Google
Admin Toolbox: https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#TXT/_acme-challenge.cloud-atlas.dev.
Look for one or more bolded line(s) below the line ';ANSWER'. It should show the
value(s) you've just added.

This certificate expires on 2025-11-24.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.

NEXT STEPS:
- This certificate will not be renewed automatically. Autorenewal of --manual certificates requires the use of an authentication hook script (--manual-auth-hook) but one was not provided. To renew this certificate, repeat this same certbot command before the certificate's expiry date.
